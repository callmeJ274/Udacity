# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

Recon:EC2/PortProbeUnprotectedPort
Severity: Low
EC2 instance has an unprotected port which is being probed by a known malicious host.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

This finding informs you that a port on the listed EC2 instance in your AWS environment is not blocked by a security group, 
access control list (ACL), or an on-host firewall such as Linux IPTables, and that known scanners on the internet are actively probing it.
If the identified unprotected port is 22 or 3389 and you are using these ports to connect to your instance, 
you can still limit exposure by allowing access to these ports only to the IP addresses from your corporate network IP address space.
