Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
In the VPC configuration, all the route definitions have DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0.
With this config, attacker can breach into the resource in the subnet in routing table and transfer information to any IP address within or outside of VPC.
The same config with CidrIp as 0.0.0.0/0. exists in ingress and egress config of WebAppSG, AppLoadBalancerSG, AttackInstanceSG
This will leads to unwanted connections from attackers.

# Poor practice 2
IAM Role has access to any s3 bucket instance. This violates to the least privilege principle, 
as recommendation, roles should be specific to the list of resources and actions they are allowed to.
